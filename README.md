This is a project to create the underlying infrastructure of an IDE as an Android application.

The initial goals are:
 - To create a text editor that fulfills the basic needs of programmers
 - To provide interface features that make programming practical on a mobile device
 - To incorporate version control in some form (ideally working with github's API)
 - To create models for various programming languages (starting with Java, PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Ruby)
 -- These would be the basis for code-completion and real-time syntax checking

Later goals will include:
 - A robust interface to reduce the amount of typing
 - Voice-command interfaces
 - Automation integration
 - Source code minification
 -- This is more significant than it seems; The IDE should be responsible for how code appears in the editor, rather than the coder. With that in mind, the coder can customize the way the code renders to fit their preferred syntax styling. Naturally, this may be harder to implement than it is to imagine.
